Hello;

The code to the webpage is really simple to understand;
Fast navigation;
we used alot of bootstrap so we do not have alot of CSS code;
JavaScript is only used for the Back to top button;
color pallete is plain in a good way;


suggetions to develop the website;
add images to attract more people;
use bootstrap more to make it simpler and less css;
